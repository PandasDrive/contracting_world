        <h1>What is a "Contingent Offer?"</h1>
        <p>This is the "golden ticket" that makes the contracting world spin.</p>

        <h2>It's a Real Job Offer... With a Catch.</h2>
        <p>
            A "contingent offer" is a formal job offer that is <strong>contingent (or dependent)</strong> 
            on a future event happening. If the event happens, you have the job. If it fails, the offer
            is void.
        </p>

        <h3>The Most Common "Contingencies"</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Contract Award (The Big One):</strong> This is the most common. A company (like Northrop Grumman) 
                is trying to win the "MIDAS STUDIES" contract. They will give you an offer that says, 
                "This job is contingent on us *winning* the MIDAS contract." This is how they build their 
                team before they even have the work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Customer Approval:</strong> "This offer is contingent on the *government customer* (e.g., the NGA) approving your resume and clearance for this specific role."
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Clearance Crossover:</strong> "This offer is contingent on your security clearance 
                being successfully 'crossed over' to our company's control."
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>This is What Causes the "Job Hop"</h2>
        <p>
            When a contract is "re-competed," your current company (Zeta) might *lose* the contract, 
            and a new company (Northrop Grumman) *wins* it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new company (Northrop) now has to hire 50 people to do the *exact same jobs* that Zeta's 
            employees were doing. The easiest way to do this is to give all 50 Zeta employees a 
            <strong>contingent offer</strong>. This is why you see people "hop" from company to company 
            while doing the same job, at the same desk, for the same customer.
