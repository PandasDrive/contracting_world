# 🌌 The Contracting Ecosystem Explorer

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Production Ready**

A comprehensive, interactive guide to understanding the complex world of cleared government contracting. This project transforms the confusing landscape of government contracting into an accessible, visually stunning educational experience with direct job search integration.

## 🎯 Core Concept: The "Three-Level Model of Volatility"

This project explains the "three-level" contracting model (Customer → Prime → Sub) and why the market is so volatile and defined by "job hopping." The central theme is that a contractor's employment is tied to a specific Task Order, not just the company they work for. When that Task Order is "re-competed," the winning and losing companies cause a wave of Contingent Offers, forcing employees to "hop" to a new company to keep the same job.
