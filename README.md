# 🌌 The Contracting Ecosystem Explorer

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Production Ready**

A comprehensive, interactive guide to understanding the complex world of cleared government contracting. This project transforms the confusing landscape of government contracting into an accessible, visually stunning educational experience.

## 🎯 Core Concept: The "Three-Level Model of Volatility"

This project explains the "three-level" contracting model (Customer → Prime → Sub) and why the market is so volatile and defined by "job hopping." The central theme is that a contractor's employment is tied to a specific Task Order, not just the company they work for. When that Task Order is "re-competed," the winning and losing companies cause a wave of Contingent Offers, forcing employees to "hop" to a new company to keep the same job.
